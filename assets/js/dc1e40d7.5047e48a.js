Set up the Client program component in the pipeline, which is responsible for reading raw spectrum data packets from a radio device, and unpacking/processing them into a more human-readable format. The client program is highly customizable to your own application. In the case of our airplane tracker application, it specifically processes ADS-B packets using the dump1090 software which decodes the data into a more human-readable format, in this case a JSON file."},"replicate/dashboard":{"id":"replicate/dashboard","title":"Dashboards","description":"1.
