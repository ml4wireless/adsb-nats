# Annotator

> The Annotator is a module within our data pipeline that is responsible for enriching the processed radio data with additional meaningful information. For our application, we downloaded data from the [FAA‚Äôs (Federal Aviation Administration) Releasable Aircraft Database](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download) and used it to add additional information to each packet. 
> 

> This documentation will take you through the process of containerizing the annotator and running it locally, and then migrating it to AWS. If you aren‚Äôt sure what that means no worries there will explanations at each step. 
>

## 1. Local: Containerizing & Running the Annotator

**Key Terms:**
>**Containerizing** applications provides portability, allowing them to run consistently across different environments, and enables efficient resource utilization and scalability, making it easier to deploy, manage, and scale applications effectively. Containerizing applications using Docker provides additional advantages such as simplified packaging, distribution, and deployment. **Docker** allows for easy creation and management of containers, making it a popular choice for containerization due to its comprehensive tooling and ecosystem support.
>

üí° In this section will be containerizing and running the annotator program locally (on a personal computer and not in      AWS). This will essentially take the data packets from the client program and supplement them with additional information from another data source (For our airplane tracker application, we downloaded data from the [FAA‚Äôs (Federal Aviation Administration) Releasable Aircraft Database](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download) and used it to append additional information to each packet).


### 1. Prep for Containerization
- Navigate to the annotator‚Äôs directory (`aircraft-annotator`) within the cloned repo. This entire section of setup will be performed within this directory.
- Download the latest ‚ÄúYearly Aircraft Registration Database‚Äù data from  [FAA‚Äôs (Federal Aviation Administration) Releasable Aircraft Database](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download) directly into the `aircraft-annotator` directory. Unzip the downloaded files & run¬†`cleanup-data.sh` to clean the data.
---
- Use the following commands to install `pipreqs` (if not already installed) and auto-generate a `requirements.txt` file
    ```shell
    pip install pipreqs
    pipreqs 
    ```
- Create a file `Dockerfile` in the annotator‚Äôs directory as below:
    ```python
    FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

    WORKDIR /aircraft-annotator/

    COPY . .

    # install required dependencies
    RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    CMD python3 annotator.py .
    ```
- Create `build-docker.sh`, a script for later use in building the docker image as below:
    ```shell
    #!/bin/sh
    # script to build the nats-annotator image
    docker build -t nats-annotator .
    ```
- Create `run-docker.sh`, a script for later use in running the docker image, as below. Be sure to update the contents of the NATS_HOST and TOKEN as appropriate.
    ```shell
    TODO: UPDATE
    #!/bin/sh

    export NATS_HOST="<insert nats_host here>"
        #in this format: nats://<TOKEN>@<AWS-NLB-External-IP>:4222
            #ex:nats://TOKEN@a15d11836d0644f6da0d09cbd81fae4f-949e37ea0352e6ad.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:4222

    export TOKEN="<insert token here>"

    docker run --network "host" --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb/dev/bus/usb \
        -e NATS_HOST=${NATS_HOST} \
        -e TOKEN=${TOKEN} \
        nats-annotator:latest
    ```
    - See another example here: https://github.com/ml4wireless/adsb-nats/blob/1ec407770eaef76e089661c8
    - Note: If using the minikube setup outlined in the Set Up phase of this documentation along with a Mac machine, you may need to define the NATS_HOST in the following alternative way: 
        ```bash
        export NATS_HOST=${NATS_HOST:-"docker.for.mac.host.internal:<port>"} 
        export TOKEN=${TOKEN:-"<token>"}
        ```

### 2. Containerization & Running
- Build a Docker image for the annotator (image name `nats-annotator`) using the build script we created earlier: 
    - *Note:* If it is your first time running the script, run `chmod +x run-docker.sh` to make it executable
    ```bash
    ./build-docker.sh
    ```
    - *Optional ‚Äî Verify that the Docker build worked:* use the command `docker images` to list all available images, and make sure that the new `nats-annotator` image is listed
- Use the script `run-docker.sh` we created earlier to start the execution of the container:
    - *Note:* If it is your first time running the script, run `chmod +x run-docker.sh` to make it executable
    ```bash
    ./run-docker.sh
    ```

```text
üí° You should next see continuous print statements/logs from the annotator program like "Published annotation ...". 
```
---
```text
üí° Now lets test our local containerized annotator with messages from the NATS server:
```
```bash
export NATS_HOST="<insert nats_host here>"
export TOKEN="<insert token here>"

# try subscribing to the stream of annotated data and you should get messages from the annotator on your console
nats sub -s¬†$NATS_HOST "plane.loc.annotated"
```

Example Output:

#### Additional Useful Commands
- Additional Docker Commands
    ```bash
    # **NOTE #to stop running 
    docker stop <container_id>  #find container id -> docker ps
    ```

## 2. AWS: Containerizing & Running the Annotator
> The Annotator is a module within our data pipeline that is responsible for enriching the processed radio data with additional meaningful information. For our application, we downloaded data from the [FAA‚Äôs (Federal Aviation Administration) Releasable Aircraft Database](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download) and used it to add additional information to each packet. 
> 

> We will now be running the containerized Annotator on an AWS EC2 instance to integrate it with the rest of our NATS pipeline backbone. Running the Annotator in the cloud also ensures scalability to handle varying workloads and high availability by leveraging the cloud infrastructure, while running it locally limits scalability and may result in resource constraints.
>

### Containerization

#### 1. Create & Set up an EC2 Instance for the Annotator
> An **EC2 instance** is a virtual server in the cloud provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of their Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. It offers scalable computing capacity with configurable resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking capabilities, allowing users to deploy and run applications on virtual machines in the AWS cloud.
>

- Sign in to your AWS console, navigate to the EC2 service and create a new EC2 instance called `annotator-server`
    - For the AMI & Instance type, we used `Amazon Linux` and `t3.small` respectively, with configurations as below:
        ![Config 1](/img/annotator_2.png)
        ![Config 2](/img/annotator_3.png)
    - You also will have to add a Key Pair, Security Group, and any other EC2 specifications. Reference our Security Group configurations below if needed-
        - We created a new security group for the instance that allows port 22 (SSH) (and HTTP/HTTPS but not directly needed)
        - Screenshots of the Inbound and Outbound rules for our Security Group are below:
            ![Security Group Config 1](/img/annotator_4.png)
            ![Security Group Config 2](/img/annotator_5.png)
        - Make sure to link this Security Group with the `annotator-server` EC2 instance within its settings.
    - Finally for the instance‚Äôs storage allowance, we kept the default setting as below:
        ![Storage Config 1](/img/annotator_6.png)
- Proceed to install and set up docker on the EC2 instance:
    ```shell
    # in EC2 terminal
    # based on: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-docker-on-amazon-linux-2/

    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install docker
    sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
    id ec2-user
    newgrp docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker.service
    sudo systemctl start docker.service
    sudo systemctl status docker.service
    ```

#### 2. Collect the Annotator Data into an S3 Bucket
üí° *In this section, we will go over how to move the locally downloaded files of data that are needed by the annotator into an S3 bucket to Reduce Docker Image Size. This way we do not need to store this data in our AWS EC2 instance, and it can be downloaded upon the execution of the container.*

##### Create and Store Data in S3 Bucket
- Navigate to the S3 service within the AWS console and create a new S3 bucket `aircraft-annotator-data`
- Download the latest ‚ÄúYearly Aircraft Registration Database‚Äù data from  *[FAA‚Äôs (Federal Aviation Administration) Releasable Aircraft Database](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download)* into any other directory on your computer (NOT the  `aircraft-annotator` directory since we want this directory to be lightwright).
- Unzip the downloaded files & run¬†`cleanup-data.sh` to clean the data. Upload the CLEANED data files into the S3 bucket we just created.
- Follow the instructions in [this link](https://www.notion.so/Annotator-7a98b28d187841398f0f69e8c32261b1) to make the data public and accessible.

##### Allowing the Annotator EC2 to access the S3 Bucket
- Create an IAM role
    - Look at [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-instance-access-s3-bucket/) to learn how to give EC2 access to S3
    - Go to the EC2 instance page ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí  Security ‚Üí Modify IAM role and add the IAM role created
- Create an IAM Policy
    - Look at [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/writing-iam-policies-how-to-grant-access-to-an-amazon-s3-bucket/) to write a policy for s3 access
- ***Verify*** that the EC2 and s3 bucket are connected with the following command:
    ```bash
    aws s3 ls s3://aircraft-annotator-data 

    # output should be something like:
    # PRE ReleasableAircraft/
    ```

#### 3. Prepare for Containerization ‚Äî On Local Machine
üí° *Complete this section on your local machine!*

- Navigate to the annotator‚Äôs directory (`aircraft-annotator`). This entire section of setup will be performed within this directory.
- Use the following commands to install `pipreqs` (if not already installed) and auto-generate a `requirements.txt` file
    ```bash
    pip install pipreqs
    pipreqs 
    ```
- Create a file `Dockerfile` in the annotator‚Äôs directory as below:
    ```python
    FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

    WORKDIR /aircraft-annotator/

    COPY . .

    # install required dependencies
    RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    RUN pip3 install awscli

    # download annotator data from s3 bucket and execute annotator program
    CMD aws s3 cp s3://aircraft-annotator-data/ReleasableAircraft . --recursive; python3 annotator.py .
    ```
- Create `build-docker.sh`, a script for later use in building the docker image as below:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    # script to build the nats-annotator image
    docker build -t nats-annotator .
    ```
- Create `run-docker.sh`, a script for later use in running the docker image, as below. Be sure to update the contents of the NATS_HOST and TOKEN as appropriate.
    ```bash
    TODO: UPDATE
    #!/bin/sh

    export NATS_HOST="<insert nats_host here>"
        #in this format: nats://<TOKEN>@<AWS-NLB-External-IP>:4222
            #ex:nats://TOKEN@a15d11836d0644f6da0d09cbd81fae4f-949e37ea0352e6ad.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:4222

    export TOKEN="<insert token here>"

    docker run --network "host" --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb/dev/bus/usb \
        -e NATS_HOST=${NATS_HOST} \
        -e TOKEN=${TOKEN} \
        nats-annotator:latest
    ```
    - See another example here: https://github.com/ml4wireless/adsb-nats/blob/1ec407770eaef76e089661c8
    - Note: If using the minikube setup outlined in the Set Up phase of this documentation along with a Mac machine, you may need to define the NATS_HOST in the following alternative way: 
        ```bash
        export NATS_HOST=${NATS_HOST:-"docker.for.mac.host.internal:<port>"} 
        export TOKEN=${TOKEN:-"<token>"}
        ```

#### 4. Transfer files from Local Machine to EC2 Instance
- Delete any FAA data files from the local `aircraft-annotator` directory, now that they are stored and retrievable from the **S3 bucket**
- Find and record your `annotator-server` EC2‚Äôs hostname from the AWS Console
    - *Go to this instance‚Äôs page in the AWS Console and click ‚ÄòConnect‚Äô. On the ‚ÄúConnect to Instance‚Äù page, navigate to the ‚ÄúSSH Client‚Äù tab and copy the EC2 hostname from command at the bottom, under ‚ÄúExample‚Äù*
    - for example:
        ![hostname example](/img/annotator_7.png)
- Use SCP to copy the local `aircraft-annotator` directory to the EC2 instance:
    ```shell
    # in LOCAL terminal copy local files into EC2 using SCP - replace key filename, paths, ec2 hostname as needed 
    scp -i <key_filename> -r <local_path_to_aircraft-annotator_directory> <ec2_hostname>:~/annotator-dir

    #---------- examples ---------------------------

    # scp -i annotator-new.pem -r /Users/johndoe/Documents/GitHub/adsb-nats/aircraft-annotator ec2-user@ec2-35-86-207-137.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/annotator-dir
    ```

### Running
#### 5. Running the Containerized Annotator on AWS
- Connect to the `annotator-server` EC2 instance via SSH
    - *For instructions, go to this instance‚Äôs page in the AWS Console and click ‚ÄòConnect‚Äô. On the ‚ÄúConnect to Instance‚Äù page, navigate to the ‚ÄúSSH Client‚Äù tab and copy the command at the bottom, under ‚ÄúExample‚Äù*
- Build a Docker image for the annotator (image name `nats-annotator`) using the build script we created earlier:
    - *Note:* If it is your first time running the script, run `chmod +x [run-docker.sh](http://run-docker.sh)` to make it executable
        ```bash
        ./build-docker-aws.sh
        ```
    - *Optional Check*: use the command `docker images` to list all available images, and make sure that the new `nats-annotator` image is listed
- Create a screen session to use to keep the annotator program **executing in the background**:
    - otherwise it will stop annotating the data the second you exit the program
        ```bash
        # in EC2 terminal
        screen -S <session_name>
        ```
- Use the script `run-docker.sh` we created earlier to start the execution of the container:
    - Add in your token in the run-docker.sh by using vim commands in the EC2
    - *Note:* If it is your first time running the script, run chmod +x run-docker.sh to make it executable
        ```bash
        ./run-docker.sh
        ```
    - You should first see confirmation of the annotator data being downloaded from the s3 bucket
    - You should next see continuous print statements/logs from the annotator program like "Published annotation ..."
- Detach the Screen session *(keeps the annotator program running in the background even if you exit the terminal)*
    - press `ctrl + a + d` to detach it -> you are now done (you may have to try doing this multiple times for it to work)
    - *Optional Check: To make sure the screen session was created and detached, use the command `screen -list`. You should see something like this-*
        ![screen example](/img/annotator_8.png)

---
üí° Now lets test our containerized annotator with messages from the NATS server. Run the following command on your local terminal to hopefully see the stream of annotated messages from the Annotator module working on cloud.

```shell
export NATS_HOST="<insert nats_host here>"
export TOKEN="<insert token here>"

# try subscribing to the stream of annotated data and you should get messages from the annotator on your console
nats sub -s¬†$NATS_HOST "plane.loc.annotated"
```

Example Output:
